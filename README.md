To build a virtual trading stock system using Yahoo Finance API

1. Buy stocks - user will invest some budget on N number of stocks in varying percentages. The percentage should sum up to 100. The budget will be allocated to the stocks according to the percentage. When the user provides input, a trade ID is returned, confirming the user's transaction.
2. Check Portfolio - With returned trade ID in previous step, user can compare the loss/gain on each stock which he/she has invested.


Achieved Outcome:
Was able to successfully generate trade ID on the server side. But was unable to retrieve it to client side. Thus, unable to test the rest of the code.
